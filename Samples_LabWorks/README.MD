## Protocols for DNA extraction

Originally, the authors have 119 samples and with corresponding 212 libraries. Finally, 69 samples (from 95 ancient DNA libraries) were used in their study after screening and quality control. [Online Table 1](OnlineTable1)

Ancient DNA were extracted and libraries were prepared in three different labs: 

1. The adelaide lab, the University of Adelaide's [Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/about/). n = 151 libraires.

2. The Tubingen lab, the [Institute for Archaeological Sciences at the University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/interfaculty-facilities/tza/tza/), Germany. The 9 Stuttgart *Linienbandkeramik*(LBK) samples, n = 16 libraries.

3. The Boston lab, the Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA, [David Reich's lab](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/). n =45 libraries.



DNA extraction was carried out in the clean-room facilities, using Silica-based DNA extraction method/protocal by [Jesse Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8)(Tubingen lab & Boston lab) and [Brotherton *et al*. (2013)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2656#s1)(Adelaide lab).

Here is summary of ancient DNA extraction protocal used by other papers:

- "Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day Europeans" [Iosif Lazaridi *et al*. (2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13673) uses [Jesse Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8).

- "Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East" [Iosif Lazaridi *et al*. (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19310) uses [Jesse Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8), but replaced the assembly of Qiagen MinElute columns and extension reservoirs from Zymo Research with a High Pure Extender Assembly from the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit (Roche Applied Science).

- "The Genomic Formation of South and Central Asia" [Vagheesh Narasimhan *et al*. (2018)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/292581v1) uses [Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8) and [Petra Korlević *et al.* (2015)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26260087).

- "Reconstructing the Deep Population History of Central and South America" [Cosimo Posth   *et al*. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418313801) uses [Jesse Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8).


Recent new protocal： 

“Extraction of highly degraded DNA from ancient bones, teeth and sediments for high-throughput sequencing” [Nadin Rohland *et al*. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0050-5) 

This protocol update above replaces a now-outdated version that was published 11 years ago, before high-throughput sequencing technologies became widely available.[Nadin Rohland *et al*. (2007)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2007.247),"Ancient DNA extraction from bones and teeth."

Jesse Dabney also updated his 2013 ancient DNA extraction protocal in 2019 March: "Extraction of Highly Degraded DNA from Ancient Bones and Teeth" , [Jesse Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-4939-9176-1_4).
