## Protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation

Originally, the authors have 119 samples and with corresponding 212 libraries. Finally, 69 samples (from 95 ancient DNA libraries) were used in their study after screening and quality control. [Online Table 1](OnlineTable1)

Ancient DNA were extracted and libraries were prepared in three different labs: 

1. The adelaide lab, the University of Adelaide's [Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/about/). n = 151 libraires.

2. The Tubingen lab, the [Institute for Archaeological Sciences at the University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/interfaculty-facilities/tza/tza/), Germany. The 9 Stuttgart *Linienbandkeramik*(LBK) samples, n = 16 libraries.

3. The Boston lab, the Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA, [David Reich's lab](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/). n =45 libraries.



DNA extraction was carried out in the clean-room facilities, using Silica-based DNA extraction method/protocal by [Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8)(Tubingen lab & Boston lab) and [Brotherton *et al*. (2013)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2656#s1)(Adelaide lab).

Here is summary of ancient DNA extraction protocal used by other papers:
