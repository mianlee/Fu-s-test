## Protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation

Originally, the authors have 119 samples and with corresponding 212 libraries. Finally, 69 samples (from 95 ancient DNA libraries) were used in their study after screening and quality control. [Online Table 1](OnlineTable1)

Ancient DNA were extracted and libraries were prepared in three different labs: 

1. The adelaide lab, the University of Adelaide's [Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/about/). n = 151 libraires.

2. The Tubingen lab, the [University of Tubingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/), Germany. The 9 Stuttgart *Linienbandkeramik*(LBK) samples, n = 16 libraries.

3. The Boston lab, the Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA, [David Reich's lab](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/). n =45 libraries.



DNA extraction was carried out in the clean-room facilities, using Silica-based DNA extraction method/protocal by [Dbney et al. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8)
