## Protocols for DNA extraction

Originally, the authors have 119 samples and with corresponding 212 libraries. Finally, 69 samples (from 95 ancient DNA libraries) were used in their study after screening and quality control. [Online Table 1](OnlineTable1)

Ancient DNA were extracted and libraries were prepared in three different labs: 

1. The adelaide lab, the University of Adelaide's [Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/about/). n = 151 libraires.

2. The Tubingen lab, the [Institute for Archaeological Sciences at the University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/interfaculty-facilities/tza/tza/), Germany. The 9 Stuttgart *Linienbandkeramik*(LBK) samples, n = 16 libraries.

3. The Boston lab, the Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA, [David Reich's lab](https://reich.hms.harvard.edu/). n =45 libraries.



DNA extraction was carried out in the clean-room facilities, using Silica-based DNA extraction method/protocal by [Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8)(Tubingen lab & Boston lab) and [Brotherton *et al*. (2013)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2656#s1)(Adelaide lab).

Here is summary of ancient DNA extraction protocal used by other papers:

- "Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day Europeans" [Iosif Lazaridi *et al*. (2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13673) uses [Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8).

- "Genomic insights into the origin of farming in the ancient Near East" [Iosif Lazaridi *et al*. (2016)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature19310) uses [Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8), but replaced the assembly of Qiagen MinElute columns and extension reservoirs from Zymo Research with a High Pure Extender Assembly from the High Pure Viral Nucleic Acid Large Volume Kit (Roche Applied Science).

- "Reconstructing the Deep Population History of Central and South America" [Posth Cosimo  *et al*. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867418313801) uses [Dabney *et al*. (2013)](https://www.pnas.org/content/110/39/15758#sec-8).


Recent new protocal： “Extraction of highly degraded DNA from ancient bones, teeth and sediments for high-throughput sequencing” [Rohland Nadin *et al*. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0050-5)
