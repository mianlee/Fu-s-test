## Protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation

Originally, the authors have 119 samples and with corresponding 212 libraries. Finally, 69 samples (from 95 ancient DnA libraries) were used in their study after screening. 

Ancient DNA were extracted and libraries were prepared in three different labs: 

1. The adelaide lab, the University of Adelaide's [Australian Centre for Ancient DNA (ACAD)](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/acad/about/).
