I am trying to repeat analyses in the nature paper: **"Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe"**. [(1)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317)

**Reference**: Haak, W., Lazaridis, I., Patterson, N., Rohland, N., Mallick, S., Llamas, B., ... & Fu, Q. (2015). **Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe**. Nature, 522(7555), 207.
