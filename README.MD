I am trying to repeat all analyses in the nature paper named: **"Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe"**. [(1)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317)

Here, I record down all steps, codes and solutions, and my researches about the backgroud. My solutions, all programs that I used may be different from the orginal paper, but would acheive the same goal or at least do similar work. I can't repeat the whole process perfectly, but I will try my best.
