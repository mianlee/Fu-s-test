My name is Mian Li, a PhD student at Binghamton University. This challage (at least to me) is given by Dr. Fu Qiaomei during my post-doc interview.

I am trying to repeat all analyses in the nature paper named: **"Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe"**.

Here, I record down all steps, codes and solutions, and my researches about the backgroud. My solutions, all programs that I used may be different from the orginal paper, but would acheive the same goal or at least do similar work. I can't repeat the whole process perfectly, but I will try my best.


This github is about, here I quote my favorite words from [Hansj√∂rg Plieninger](https://hansjoerg.me/page/about/):

- things I learned, to make it simpler for other people to learn the same thing quicker,
- things I learned, to make it simpler for me to do the same thing quicker next time,
- things I love, to make it simpler for others to love them, too,
- things I do, to make it simpler for you to get in touch with me.


### ```It was simple, but you know, it's always simple when you've done it.```
