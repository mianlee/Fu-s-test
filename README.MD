### 1. [Protocols for DNA extraction and library preparation](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Samples_LabWorks)

   - [Ancient DNA damage pattern](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Ancient_DNA_Damage).
   
   - [Ancient DNA Assessment](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Ancient_DNA_Assessment), like dectecting damge pattern and contaminations.

Here, I did some basic researches on: 
   
   1. Current extraction protocols for ancient DNA, why/how to use UDG treatment (full and partial).
   
   2. DNA sequencing library preparations and how they related to ancient DNA damage pattern.
   
   3. Ancient DNA damage pattern.
   
And I figured out how to use ```mapDamage2```, ```Mapping-Iterative-Assembler(MIA)``` and ```schmutzi``` to detect ancient DNA damage pattern and contamination. How to use ```PMDtools``` to separate endogenous ancient DNA from modern day contamination.
   
### 2. [Mitochondrial genome analysis](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Mitochondrial_DNA_Analysis)

Assignning mtDNA haplogroup from NGS data and how to use ```snakemake``` to automate the analysis.

### 3. [Description of ancient samples and archaeological context](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Sample_Background)

Summary all ancient samples used in the paper.

### 4. [Sex determination](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Sex_determination) and [Y chromosome analysis](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Y%20haplogroup%20prediction)

### 5. [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/PCA_analysis)

How did I conduct PCA analysis, how did I plot the results nicely and my R codes/solution for that.

### 6. [ADMIXTURE analysis](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Admixture)

How did I format the data, run the analysis and R code/solution for plotting the results nicely.

### 7. [Population relationships and admixture using f-statistics](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/Outgroup_F3_Statistics)

### 8. [Phylogenetic relationships of ancient Eurasians](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/qpGraph)

### 9. Inference of admixture proportions without detailed phylogenetic modeling

### 10. [Number of streams of migration into ancient Europe](https://github.com/mianlee/Fu-s-test/tree/master/qpWave_and_qpAdm)

### 11. Relevance of ancient DNA to the problem of Indo-European language dispersals


## About myself and this github repository

My name is Mian Li, a PhD student at Binghamton University. This challage (at least to me) is given by Dr. Fu Qiaomei during my post-doc interview.

I am trying to repeat all analyses in the Nature paper named: **"Massive migration from the steppe was a source for Indo-European languages in Europe"**.

Here, I will write down all steps, codes and solutions for the test, and my researches about the backgroud. My solutions, all programs that I used may be different from the orginal paper, but would acheive the same goal or at least do similar work. I can't repeat the whole process perfectly, but I will try my best.


This github is about, here I quote my favorite words from [Hansj√∂rg Plieninger](https://hansjoerg.me/page/about/):

- things I learned, to make it simpler for other people to learn the same thing quicker,
- things I learned, to make it simpler for me to do the same thing quicker next time,
- things I love, to make it simpler for others to love them, too,
- things I do, to make it simpler for you to get in touch with me.


### ```It was simple, but you know, it's always simple when you've done it.```
