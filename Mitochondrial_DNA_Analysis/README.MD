**Here I am trying to repeat all analyses related to mitochondrial DNA in [Haak *et al*. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317) paper.**

1. Assessment of ancient DNA authenticity, search for evidence of contamination in the mitochondrial DNA.

2. Assignning mtDNA haplogroup from NGS data.

3. Population genetic analysis using mtDNA. 


**Goals**:

- Know how to estimate contamination rate using mitochondrial DNA

- Understand the basic workflow for determining human mtDNA lineages from NGS data.

- Be familiar with available online resources for researching human mtDNA haplogroup diversity and finding comparative datasets.

- Understand how ancient mtDNA results are interpreted and contextualized with other lines of evidence.



### mtDNA damage pattern

Here, I used NGS data from sample I0061, [here](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/SAMEA3270053). I checked ancient DNA damage pattern for library **S0061** (non-UDG), **S0670**(half-UDG) and **S0230** (full-UDG) using [mapDamage2](https://ginolhac.github.io/mapDamage/). You can find ```.bam``` file here: [S0061](Data/S0061.bam), [S0670](Data/S0670.bam), [S0230](Data/S0230.bam).
