Here I am trying to repeat all analyses related to mitochondrial DNA in [Haak *et al*. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317) paper.

1. Assessment of ancient DNA authenticity, search for evidence of contamination in the mitochondrial DNA.

2. Assignning mtDNA haplogroup from NGS data.

3. Population genetic analysis using mtDNA. 


Goals:

- Know how to estimate contamination rate using mitochondrial DNA

- Understand the basic workflow for determining human mtDNA lineages from NGS data.

- Be familiar with available online resources for researching human mtDNA haplogroup diversity and finding comparative datasets.

- Understand how ancient mtDNA results are interpreted and contextualized with other lines of evidence.
