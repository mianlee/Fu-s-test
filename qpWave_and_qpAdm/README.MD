##  *qpWave* and *qpAdm*: Admixture modelling

***f3*** and ***D/f4*** statistics are very useful tools to test simple phylogenetic hypotheses, such as whether certain population is sharing more genetic drift with one population than with other populations (outgroup-***f3***), whether the relationship of four test populations fits into a tree. However, and individual ***f3*** and ***D/f4*** - statistics cannot provide specifics of this "non-treeness": such as **1)** what is the magnitude and direction of gene flow, **2)** how many gene flows are required to model the relationship between the populations used, and **3)** whether the populations used are sufficient to model their relationships (or an unsampled lineage is required).

Both ***qpWave*** and ***qpAdm*** can be though of as more complex and powerful extensions of the basic ideas behind a simple ***f4*** statistic. Building upon the ***f4*** theory and generalizing it, ***qpWave*** makes it possible to find the lowest number of “streams of ancestry” between two groups of populations that is consistent with the data. Extending the concept of ***f4*** statistics even further, ***qpAdm*** allows to find the proportions of ancestry from a set of ancestral populations that contributed ancestry to our population of interest.

***QpWave*** **and its derivative** ***qpAdm*** **are tools for summarizing information from multiple F-statistics to make such sophisticated inferences possible to a substantial degree. In this section, we focus on the following specific questions:**

1. Detecting the minimum number of independent gene pools to explain a set of target populations (qpWave)

2. Testing sufficienty of an admixture model within the resolution of data (qpAdm)

3. Estimating admixture proportions (qpAdm)
