## Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
Principal components analysis, PCA, is a one of the most useful statistical method used in population genetics to identify and visualize population structure in the distribution of genetic variation across geographical location and ethic backgroud, and genetic variation over time. In general, it allows breaking down high-dimensional datasets to two or more dimensions for visualisation in a two-dimensional space. 

#### SmartPCA
The smartpca program uses a combination of Principal Component Analysis (PCA; a standard statistical method) and new statistics designed specifically for genomic data. The methods are described in detail in an excellent and accessible [paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020190), [github manual](https://github.com/chrchang/eigensoft/blob/master/POPGEN/%23README%23)  under [eigensoft package](https://github.com/chrchang/eigensoft) by the authors of the program.
