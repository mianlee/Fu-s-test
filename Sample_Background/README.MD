## Neolithic Period

The term **Neolithic Period** refers to the last stage of the Stone Age, which covers three different periods: Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and **Neolithic**.

**Chronology**

The term **Neolithic** or **New Stone Age** is most frequently used in connection with **agriculture**, which is the time when cereal cultivation and animal domestication was introduced. Because agriculture developed at different times in different regions of the world, there is no single date for the beginning of the Neolithic. In the Near East, agriculture was developed around 9,000 BCE, in Southeast Europe around 7,000 BCE, and later in other regions. Even within a specific region, agriculture developed during different times. For example, agriculture first developed in Southeast Europe about 7,000 BCE, in Central Europe about 5,500 BCE, and Northern Europe about 4,000 BCE.

**Pottery** is another element that makes the dating of the Neolithic problematic. In some regions, the appearance of pottery is considered a symbol of the Neolithic, but this notion makes the term Neolithic even more ambiguous, since the use of pottery does not always occur after agriculture: in Japan, pottery appears before agriculture, while in the Near East agriculture pre-dates pottery production. All these factors make the starting point of the Neolithic somewhat fuzzy. 

The [Haak *et al*. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317) follows the **central European chronology**.


**Related Cultues in central Europe**:

The first farmers of the ENE **linear pottery culture** (LBK, 5450–4775 BC), through the subsequent **Rössen** (4625–4250 BC), **Schöningen** (4100–3950 BC), **Baalberge** (3950–3400 BC) and **Salzmünde** (3400–3025 BC) cultures. These were followed by two of the first pan-European Late Neolithic (LNE) cultural complexes, the **Corded War**e (CWC, 2800–2050 BC) and **Bell Beaker** (BBC, 2500–2050 BC) cultures, before the emergence of the Early Bronze Age with the **Unetice culture** (2200–1575 BC).

## General asssigning ancient individuals/populations

Here, I breifly summerized all individuals used in [Haak *et al*. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317) paper. The names represents sometimes the location the human remain discovered, sometimes the chronological age, sometimes culture name. It just depends upon how you group people. I also summerized each ancient individual in details.

**Note**:

**Starčevo–Kőrös–Criș culture (8200-6500 years ago)**

It encompasses various Early Neolithic archeological cultures from the Balkans, it represents **the advance of Early Neolithic farmers from Anatolia to south-east Europe**, including present-day Bulgaria, Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, northern Croatia, south-west Hungary, and Romania. The Starčevo–Kőrös–Criș culture is the precursor of the Alföld Linear Pottery, the LBK culture, and the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture - in other words all the Early Neolithic cultures from northern France to western Ukraine.

**Linear Pottery (LBK) culture (7500 - 6500 years ago)**  

The culture is also known under the names of Linear Band Ware, Linear Ware, Linear Ceramics or Incised Ware culture. It is commonly abbreviated as **LBK**, from the German ***Linearbandkeramik***.

It represents the advance of Early Neolithic farmers from the Starčevo-Körös culture across central Europe, starting from what is now **Hungary** and spreading north to the Czech Republic and Poland, west across Germany to Belgium and northern France, and east to western Ukraine, northern Moldova and north-eastern Romania.

The Hungarians tend to use DVK, Dunántúl Vonaldiszes Kerámia, translated as "Transdanubian Linear Pottery (LBKT)", Transdanubia is a traditional region of western Hungary.


**Cardium Pottery culture (8400 - 7500 years ago)**

The first farmers entering Europe about 8,000 years ago coming from the Near East spread through the continent following two different routes: one to Central Europe via the Danube, and the other towards the Iberian peninsula following the Mediterranean coast. These latter farmers developed their own cultural tradition: the Cardium Pottery, so-called due to a characteristic incised decoration made with the edges of bivalves shells belonging to the genus *Cerastoderma* (formerly *Cardium*).

Cardium pottery or Cardial ware is a Neolithic decorative style that gets its name from the imprinting of the clay with the shell of the cockle, an edible marine mollusk formerly known as *Cardium edulis* (now *Cerastoderma edule*). These forms of pottery are in turn used to define the Neolithic culture which produced and spread them, mostly commonly called the "Cardial culture".

The alternative name impressed ware is given by some archaeologists to define this culture, because impressions can be with sharp objects other than cockle shell, such as a nail or comb. Impressed pottery is much more widespread than the Cardial. The sequence in prehistoric Europe has traditionally been supposed to start with widespread Cardial ware, and then to develop other methods of impression locally, termed "epi-Cardial".

**Esperstedt**

Esperstedt is a village and a former municipality in the Saalekreis district, Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.

**Baalberge Group**

The Baalberge Group (German: *Baalberger Kultur*) was a late neolithic culture whose remains are found in central Germany. It is named after its first findspot: on the Schneiderberg at Baalberge, Salzlandkreis, Saxony-Anhalt. It appears to be the oldest grouping of the Funnel Beaker culture (or Trichterbecherkultur, TRB). In Germany it is the most common of the Funnel Beaker cultures. Because of issues with the archaeological use of the term culture it is now often referred to as the Baalberge Ceramic style (Baalberger Keramikstil). It is part of Funnelbeaker phase TRB-MES II and III in the Middle Elbe/Saale region.

An early example of the Funnel Beaker culture, the Baalberge ceramic style dates between 3800 - 3400 BC and belongs to the central German funnel beaker phases TRB-MES II (3800-3500 BC) and TRB-MES III (3500-3350 BC). It developed out of phase TRB-MES I (4100-3800 BC), innovating under the influence of southeaster and western influences (Michelsberg culture and the late Lengyel culture).

**Salzmünde Group**

The Salzmünde Group or Salzmünde Culture (German: Salzmünder Gruppe / Salzmünder Kultur) is the name for a late group from the Funnel Beaker culture in central Saale-Elbe region of Germany, which existed between 3400 and 3000 BC during the Neolithic period.

**Bernburg Culture**

Walternienburg-Bernburger Kultur refers to a mid-neolithic culture which was focused on the area of modern Saxony-Anhalt, the Thuringian Basin and Franconia from 3200 to 2800 BC. It consisted of two regional groups, Walternienburg and Bernburg which interacted closely with each other. Both are named after burial sites in Saxony-Anhalt.

A kurgan (Russian: курга́н) is a tumulus, a type of burial mound or barrow, heaped over a burial chamber, often of wood.The Russian noun, already attested in Old East Slavic, comes from an unidentified Turkic language, compare Modern Turkish kurğan, which means "fortress". Kurgans are mounds of earth and stones raised over a grave or graves.

**Yamnaya culture**

The Yamnaya culture , also known as  Pit Grave culture, was a late Copper Age to early Bronze Age archaeological culture of the region between the Southern Bug, Dniester, and Ural rivers (the Pontic steppe), dating to 3300–2600 BC. Generally considered by linguists as the homeland of the Proto-Indo-European language.

**Bell Beaker and Corded Ware culture**

During the third millennium BC, two new archaeological pottery styles expanded across Europe and replaced many of the more localized styles that had preceded them1. The expansion of the ‘Corded Ware complex’ in north-central and northeastern Europe was associated with people who derived most of their ancestry from populations related to Early Bronze Age Yamnaya pastoralists from the Eurasian steppe. In western Europe there was the equally expansive ‘Bell Beaker complex’, defined by assemblages of grave goods that included stylized bell-shaped pots, copper daggers, arrowheads, stone wristguards and V-perforated buttons5. The oldest radiocarbon dates associated with Beaker pottery are from around 2750 BC in Atlantic Iberia, which has been interpreted as evidence that the Beaker complex originated in this region. However, the geographic origins of this complex are still debated and other scenarios—including an origin in the Lower Rhine area, or even multiple independent origins—are possible (Supplementary Information section 1). Regardless of geographic origin, by 2500 BC the Beaker complex had spread throughout western Europe and northwest Africa and had reached southern and Atlantic France, Italy and central Europe5, where it overlapped geographically with the Corded Ware complex.
