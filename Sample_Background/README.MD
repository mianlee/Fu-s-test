### Neolithic Period

The term **Neolithic Period** refers to the last stage of the Stone Age, which covers three different periods: Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and **Neolithic**.

**Chronology**

The term **Neolithic** or **New Stone Age** is most frequently used in connection with **agriculture**, which is the time when cereal cultivation and animal domestication was introduced. Because agriculture developed at different times in different regions of the world, there is no single date for the beginning of the Neolithic. In the Near East, agriculture was developed around 9,000 BCE, in Southeast Europe around 7,000 BCE, and later in other regions. Even within a specific region, agriculture developed during different times. For example, agriculture first developed in Southeast Europe about 7,000 BCE, in Central Europe about 5,500 BCE, and Northern Europe about 4,000 BCE.

**Pottery** is another element that makes the dating of the Neolithic problematic. In some regions, the appearance of pottery is considered a symbol of the Neolithic, but this notion makes the term Neolithic even more ambiguous, since the use of pottery does not always occur after agriculture: in Japan, pottery appears before agriculture, while in the Near East agriculture pre-dates pottery production. All these factors make the starting point of the Neolithic somewhat fuzzy. 

The [Haak *et al*. (2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317) follows the **central European chronology**.

### Hunter-gather samples

Two hunter-gather samples from western Russia.

1. **"Karelia"** individual, 7500 years old, in Karelia, Western Russia.

    mtDNA: **C1g (old C1f)**.

2. **"Samara"** individual, 7600 - 7500 years old, in Samara oblast(State), Russia.

    mtDNA: **U5a1d**.
    
### Early Neolithic 

The Early Neolithic in Europe in this study is represented by new samples reported from sites in **Hungary**, **Germany** and **Spain**.





1. "Starčevo"  individual, 7700-7500 years old, in south Hungary.

    mtDNA: **N1a1a1**.


**Note**:

**Starčevo–Kőrös–Criș culture (8200-6500 years ago)**

It encompasses various Early Neolithic archeological cultures from the Balkans, it represents **the advance of Early Neolithic farmers from Anatolia to south-east Europe**, including present-day Bulgaria, Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia, northern Croatia, south-west Hungary, and Romania. The Starčevo–Kőrös–Criș culture is the precursor of the Alföld Linear Pottery, the LBK culture, and the Cucuteni-Trypillian culture - in other words all the Early Neolithic cultures from northern France to western Ukraine.

**Linear Pottery (LBK) culture (7500 - 6500 years ago)**  

The culture is also known under the names of Linear Band Ware, Linear Ware, Linear Ceramics or Incised Ware culture. It is commonly abbreviated as **LBK**, from the German ***Linearbandkeramik***.

It represents the advance of Early Neolithic farmers from the Starčevo-Körös culture across central Europe, starting from what is now **Hungary** and spreading north to the Czech Republic and Poland, west across Germany to Belgium and northern France, and east to western Ukraine, northern Moldova and north-eastern Romania.

The Hungarians tend to use DVK, Dunántúl Vonaldiszes Kerámia, translated as "Transdanubian Linear Pottery (LBKT)", Transdanubia is a traditional region of western Hungary.
