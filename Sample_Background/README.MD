### Neolithic Period

The term **Neolithic Period** refers to the last stage of the Stone Age, which covers three different periods: Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, and **Neolithic**.

**Chronology**

The term **Neolithic** or **New Stone Age** is most frequently used in connection with **agriculture**, which is the time when cereal cultivation and animal domestication was introduced. Because agriculture developed at different times in different regions of the world, there is no single date for the beginning of the Neolithic. In the Near East, agriculture was developed around 9,000 BCE, in Southeast Europe around 7,000 BCE, and later in other regions. Even within a specific region, agriculture developed during different times. For example, agriculture first developed in Southeast Europe about 7,000 BCE, in Central Europe about 5,500 BCE, and Northern Europe about 4,000 BCE.

**Pottery** is another element that makes the dating of the Neolithic problematic. In some regions, the appearance of pottery is considered a symbol of the Neolithic, but this notion makes the term Neolithic even more ambiguous, since the use of pottery does not always occur after agriculture: in Japan, pottery appears before agriculture, while in the Near East agriculture pre-dates pottery production. All these factors make the starting point of the Neolithic somewhat fuzzy. 

The [Haak *et al*. (2015)}(https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14317) follows the **central European chronology**.

### Hunter-gather samples
