The initial peopling by Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers ~42kyrs ago and the immigration of Neolithic farmers into Europe ~8kyrs ago appear to have played important roles, but do not explain present-day mtDNA diversity. 

Ancient DNA studies([Haak Wolfgang, *et al*. 2010](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000536), [Bramanti Barbara, *et al*. 2009](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5949/137.long)) have revealed genetic discontinuities between indigenous hunter-gatherers and early farmers, and between the latter and present-day Europeans
