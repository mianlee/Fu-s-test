The initial peopling by Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers ~42kyrs ago and the immigration of Neolithic farmers into Europe ~8kyrs ago appear to have played important roles, but do not explain present-day mtDNA diversity. 

Ancient DNA studies([Haak Wolfgang, *et al*. 2010](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000536), [Bramanti Barbara, *et al*. 2009](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5949/137.long)) have revealed genetic discontinuities between indigenous hunter-gatherers and early farmers, and between the latter and present-day Europeans

In Europe, the Neolithic transition (10,000 - 6,000 years ago) from hunting and gathering to agricultural communities was one of the most important demographic events since the initial peopling of Europe by anatomically modern humans in the Upper Paleolithic (42,000 years ago).


A population of the earliest farming culture in Central Europe, the Linear Pottery Culture (LBK; 7,500 – 6,900 years ago).

The LBK population shared an affinity with the modern-day Near East and Anatolia, supporting a major genetic input from this area during the advent of farming in Europe. However, the LBK population also showed unique genetic features including a clearly distinct distribution of mitochondrial haplogroup frequencies, confirming that major demographic events continued to take place in Europe after the early Neolithic.
 
The **transition** from a **hunter–gatherer existence** to a **sedentary farming-based lifestyle** has had key consequences for human groups around the world and has profoundly shaped human societies. **Originating in the Near East around 11,000 y ago**, an **agricultural lifestyle** subsequently spread across **Europe** during the **New Stone Age (Neolithic)**. **Whether it was mediated by incoming farmers** or **driven by the transmission of innovative ideas and techniques** remains a subject of continuing debate in archaeology, anthropology, and human population genetics. Ancient DNA from the earliest farmers can provide a direct view of the genetic diversity of these populations in the earliest Neolithic. Neolithic haplotypes that left clear traces in modern populations, and the data suggest a route for the migrating farmers that extends from the Near East and Anatolia into Central Europe. When compared to indigenous hunter–gatherer populations, the unique and characteristic genetic signature of the early farmers suggests a significant demographic input from the Near East during the onset of farming in Europe.
