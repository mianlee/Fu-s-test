### Degradation/Fragmentation


Ancient DNA is expected to be highly fragmented, a reduction in DNA fragment size. In age between 4 and 13,000 years was degraded to freagements fo 40 - 500 bp.

**Cause**: Intracellular nucleases, degradation by microorganisms and other chemical processes.

**Mechnism**: It has been suggested that fragmentation is owing to **hydrolytic depurination** and sunsequent **β elimination**.

[Dabney Jesse *et al*. 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3685887/), Figure 1.

β elimination: the cleavage of the C3'-O-P bond 3' from the apurinic or apyrimidinic site in DNA via beta-elimination reaction.


**Effect**: Apurinization of DNA, strand breaks, decrease of DNA fragment size, decrease of the overall amount of DNA.

**Evidence**: the pruines adenine(A) and guanine(G) are overrepresented next to the 5' ends of DNA fragments, G residues were evern more overrepresented than A residues adjacent to the 5' ends.

Two important aspects of ancient DNA sequenceing:

1. Obtaining enough molecules to permit whole genome analysis /  maximizing the number of molecules that are extracted from ancient remains.

2. Minimizing artefacts owing to contamination and damage
