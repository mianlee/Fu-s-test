### Degradation/Fragmentation


Ancient DNA is expected to be highly fragmented, a reduction in DMA fragment size. In age between 4 and 13,000 years was degraded to freagements fo 40 - 500 bp.

Intracellular nucleases, degradation by microorganisms and other chemical processes.

It has been suggested that fragmentation is owing to hydrolytic depurination and sunsequent β elimination.

Two important aspects of ancient DNA sequenceing:

1. Obtaining enough molecules to permit whole genome analysis /  maximizing the number of molecules that are extracted from ancient remains.

2. Minimizing artefacts owing to contamination and damage
