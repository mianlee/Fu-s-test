### Origins and genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers and hunter-gatherers in Europe

Pontus Skoglund, Malmström, H., Raghavan, M., Storå, J., Hall, P., Willerslev, E., ... & Jakobsson, M. (2012). **Origins and genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers and hunter-gatherers in Europe**. Science, 336(6080), 466-469.

**Three hunter-gathers**: Ajv52, Ajv70 and Ire8. A hunter-gather context, Neolithic hunter-gathers associated with the Pitted Ware Culture (PWC).5300 to 4400 years old.

**One farmer**: Gok4. A faarming context, Neolithic farmer associated with the Funnel Beaker Culture or Trichterbecher kultur (TRB). 4921 years old. It was excavated from a megalithic burial structure in Gokhem parish, Sweden.


Analyzing DNA from four ancient skeletons and comparing it with thousands of genetic samples from living humans, a group of Scandinavian scientists reported that agriculture initially spread through Europe because farmers expanded their territory northward, not because the more primitive foragers already living there adopted it on their own.

The hunter-gatherers, from the island of Gotland, bore a distinct genetic resemblance to people alive today in Europe's extreme north. The farmer, excavated from a large stone burial structure in the mainland parish of Gokhem, about 250 miles away, had DNA more like that of modern people in southern Europe.

"People have known for some time that agriculture spread from the Middle East to Eastern Europe and northward and westward," Jakobsson said. "But it's been difficult to determine if people migrated and brought farming with them, or if local hunter-gatherers changed their practices."

**"whether the migration of people or the spread of ideas pushed farming practices north"**

### Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans

Maanasa Raghavan, Skoglund, P., Graf, K. E., Metspalu, M., Albrechtsen, A., Moltke, I., ... & Karmin, M. (2014). **Upper Palaeolithic Siberian genome reveals dual ancestry of Native Americans**. Nature, 505(7481), 87.


The authors sequenced the draft genome of an approximately **24,000-year-old** individual **(MA-1)**, from **Mal’ta** in south-central Siberia.

The **MA-1 mitochondrial genome** belongs to **haplogroup U**, which has also been found at high frequency among Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic European hunter-gatherers.

Autosomal evidence is shown that MA-1 is basal to modern-day western Eurasians and genetically closely related to modern-day Native Americans, with no close affinity to east Asians.


### Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day Europeans

Losif Lazaridis, Patterson, N., Mittnik, A., Renaud, G., Mallick, S., Kirsanow, K., ... & Berger, B. (2014). **Ancient human genomes suggest three ancestral populations for present-day Europeans**. Nature, 513(7518), 409.


This paper sequenced nine ancient genomes: 

1. ‘Stuttgart’ (19-fold coverage), a ∼7,000-year-old skeleton found in Germany in the context of artefacts from the first widespread farming culture of central Europe, the Linearbandkeramik.

2. ‘Loschbour’ (22-fold), an ∼8,000-year-old skeleton from the Loschbour rock shelter in Luxembourg, discovered in the context of hunter-gatherer artefacts (Supplementary Information sections 1 and 2).

3. seven ∼8,000-year-old samples (0.01–2.4-fold) from a hunter-gatherer burial in Motala, Sweden (the highest coverage individual was ‘Motala12’).
