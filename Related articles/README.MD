### Origins and genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers and hunter-gatherers in Europe

Skoglund Pontus., Malmström, H., Raghavan, M., Storå, J., Hall, P., Willerslev, E., ... & Jakobsson, M. (2012). **Origins and genetic legacy of Neolithic farmers and hunter-gatherers in Europe**. Science, 336(6080), 466-469.

**Three hunter-gathers**: Ajv52, Ajv70 and Ire8. A hunter-gather context, Neolithic hunter-gathers associated with the Pitted Ware Culture (PWC).5300 to 4400 years old.

**One farmer**: Gok4. A faarming context, Neolithic farmer associated with the Funnel Beaker Culture or Trichterbecher kultur (TRB). 4921 years old. It was excavated from a megalithic burial structure in Gokhem parish, Sweden.


Analyzing DNA from four ancient skeletons and comparing it with thousands of genetic samples from living humans, a group of Scandinavian scientists reported that agriculture initially spread through Europe because farmers expanded their territory northward, not because the more primitive foragers already living there adopted it on their own.

The hunter-gatherers, from the island of Gotland, bore a distinct genetic resemblance to people alive today in Europe's extreme north. The farmer, excavated from a large stone burial structure in the mainland parish of Gokhem, about 250 miles away, had DNA more like that of modern people in southern Europe.

"People have known for some time that agriculture spread from the Middle East to Eastern Europe and northward and westward," Jakobsson said. "But it's been difficult to determine if people migrated and brought farming with them, or if local hunter-gatherers changed their practices."
