F-statistics (not Wright’s fixation indexes, Fst), a simple and intuitive approach to decipher more detailed and complex questions about our history, has quickly gained in popularity. It is fist time introduced by [Reich et al. (2009)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08365) and summarized in [Patterson et al. (2012)](https://www.genetics.org/content/192/3/1065). In that framework, inference is based on “shared genetic drift” between sets ofpopulations, under the premise that shared drift implies a
shared evolutionary history. -- [Peter,BM. (2016)](https://www.genetics.org/content/202/4/1485.abstract)


The “drift” is defined as the frequency change of an allele along a graph edge (hence drift between two populations A and B is a function of the difference in the allele frequency of polymorphisms in A and B),[Patterson et al. (2012)](https://www.genetics.org/content/192/3/1065)
